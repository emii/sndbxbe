Title: Interphase chomosome intermingling
Summary: By means of image analysis the aim of this project
Abstract: By means of image analysis the aim of this project is to assess the degree of molecular interactions between different chromatin regions throughout the cell cycle. I am now working with images generated by other members of my current lab. Basically regions of ~3-10 kbp are assayed with DNA-FISH fluorescently labeled probes, later imaged. The resulting images are processed for the identification of each region, and the subsequent quantification of the distances between them.

## Another description of a project

This project was aimed at looking at the interactions between a loss-of-function mutation and an environmental perturbation. I fluorescently labeled a collection of ~400 yeast mutant-strains which were assayed for growth in a set of different predefined laboratory conditions. The measurements were performed in an automated manner, monitoring at a pace of one hour for multiple growth cycles throughout one week. This project involved the development of a user interface for controlling the automated platform (written in python). It also required the genetic manipulation of different strains of yeast for introducing the fluorescently tagged gene, as well, after performing the corresponding experiments, the data was analysed using MATLAB.
