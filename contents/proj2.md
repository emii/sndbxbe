Title: Interphase chomosome intermingling
Summary: By means of image analysis the aim of this project
Abstract: By means of image analysis the aim of this project is to assess the degree of molecular interactions between different chromatin regions throughout the cell cycle. I am now working with images generated by other members of my current lab. Basically regions of ~3-10 kbp are assayed with DNA-FISH fluorescently labeled probes, later imaged. The resulting images are processed for the identification of each region, and the subsequent quantification of the distances between them.
