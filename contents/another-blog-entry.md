Summary:The beginning

Hello there!, this might be weird to tell, and could just be the beginning of a new experiments. One of those moments to realize that getting things done is so easy!, just start by starting!

##The beginning

There was once this guy

end.

__An array like this:__

\\begin{array}{cc}
  a & b \\\\
  c & c
\\end{array}



##[Trying the MathJax thing](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/tex.html)

__Or Like This__

In inline style

	::latex::
	
	\e^{\pi i}+1 = 0 \frac{x}{y}
	
in html	

	::html::
	
	\\\\(e^{\pi i}+1 = 0 \frac{x}{y}\\\\)
	
and the rendered result:


\\\\(e^{\pi i}+1 = 0 \frac{x}{y}\\\\)


\\begin{equation}
   E = mc^2 \\\\
   e^{\pi i}+1 = 0 \frac{x}{y}
\\end{equation}

\\begin{equation\*}
   E = mc^2
\\end{equation\*}

The 2D normal function, the html:

	::html::
	
	f(x,y) = A \exp\left(- \left(\frac{(x-x_o)^2}{2\sigma_x^2} + \frac{(y-y_o)^2}...
	{2\sigma_y^2} \right)\right)
	
The result:

\\begin{equation\*}
	f(x,y) = A \exp\left(- \left(\frac{(x-x_o)^2}{2\sigma_x^2} + \frac{(y-y_o)^2}{2\sigma_y^2} \right)\right)
\\end{equation\*}


or inline thing $\\alpha = 10^2$

###[The Mexican Hat wavelet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_hat_wavelet)

__or the Ricker wavelet__ is the negative normalized second derivative of a Gaussian function, i.e., up to scale and normalization, the second Hermite function. It is a special case of the family of continuous wavelets (wavelets used in a continuous wavelet transform) known as Hermitian wavelets. It is usually only referred to as the "Mexican hat" in the Americas. The multidimensional generalization of this wavelet is called the __[Laplacian of Gaussian function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_of_Gaussian#The_Laplacian_of_Gaussian)__. In practice, this wavelet is sometimes approximated by the difference of Gaussians function, because it is separable and can therefore save considerable computation time in two or more dimensions.


__[A sombrero function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sombrero_function)__ (sometimes called besinc function or jinc function) is the 2 dimensional polar coordinate analog of the sinc function, and is so-called because it is shaped like a sombrero hat. This function is much used in image processing. It can be defined through Bessel function of the first kind
