Title: EMBL Application
Summary: brief list of the requiered fields


Here I will try to gather all the necessary information about the application process to EMBL PhD interviews.

The deadline is on 11.11.13

* Education
* Documents
* Coursework

## Research Experience
Write the title and a description of your Diploma (thesis) research, or equivalent. Indicate the significance, the aims and your contributions and, in all cases, state the number of months of research involved. If you carried out other research prior to your Diploma, or since then, please describe it briefly in a separate paragraph. List publications, if any (minimum 500 and maximum 2000 characters).

## Scientific Interests
Please write a personal statement about your scientific interests.To make your point, you may mention specific EMBL group leaders who you would be interested in working with (these may include groups that are outside of the units you have chosen on the 'programme preference' page). Please explain clearly why you would like to work in these areas of research. Please note that this part of the application serves two purposes: It allows us to find out what your scientific interests are, and it gives you the possibility to highlight group leaders whose work you are particularly interested in, including some who might not be part of the two units you selected.(minimum 500 and maximum 2000 characters)

## Scientific Reading

Which of the scientific publications you read lately impressed you most and why?Literature (author(s), title, journal, abstract, maximum 2000 characters) 

Please write a personal statement about your scientific reading habits. Please focus on the reasons why you were impressed by the scientific publication you cited above. To further illustrate your scientific interests it would be valuable to also explain how you go about the choice of literature you read. (minimum 500 characters and maximum 2000 characters)

## Honours

List any honours or awards that you feel are relevant to this application.Include dates and a short description (maximum 500 characters).

## Outside interests

List your outside interests that are not directly related to your university degree (maximum 500 characters).

## Research Units

From the description of the research activities of the various faculty members in the scientific fields represented at EMBL, please indicate at most 2 scientific fields in which you may like to do your thesis research. Only the selected units will evaluate your application. You may be invited for interview by only one of the chosen units.

Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit- MMPUwill be recruiting candidates out of the Genome Biology, Cell Biology and Biophysics, Structural and Computational Biology Units and Mouse Biology Programme.
Please choose the unit according to the unit affiliation of the EMBL Group Leader

## Research Topics

Identifying your own true research interests for becoming a PhD student is a crucial step towards your future life as a scientist. When applying for the EMBL International PhD Programme you select the two research units you are most interested in on the 'programme preference' page.

In addition, we are asking you to select a maximum of four (min. of two) of the research topics listed here that you are most interested in. This may result in additional invitations for interviews with group leaders from units other than the two units you have chosen but that are also working in the area of interest you have indicated.

The Graduate Office will not be able to provide you with any further information about possible interviews, these will only be determined once applicants are selected for interview.

## References

List the name, address and email of at least 2 and up to 3 referees who will write a letter of recommendation on your behalf.
An email will be sent to them as soon as you have saved this page and they must submit their letter using the online application system.
Please make sure to contact your referees before completing this part in order to find out if they are available and willing to provide a reference.
We strongly recommend to complete the list of referees as early as possible giving them enough time to complete your reference online.
It is your responsibility to ensure that references reach us on time.
Please note that only letters of reference submitted from an institutional e-mail address will be considered. References from private e-mail accounts i.e. hotmail, yahoo etc. will not be considered. For referees that only have a private e-mail account, please follow the procedure as set out here.

Important: PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT EMAIL ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT
The reference letters must be received before 2013/11/20, at 23:59 Central European Time (GMT +1 hour)
