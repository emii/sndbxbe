Immune system is known to respond to external perturdbations as pathogens, likewise, it has been shown that both the innate and adaptive response are triggered by cancer. Th immune system is regarded as a network of cell types interacting with ech other through various signaling molecules, cytokines being the broadest kind. Cytokines work as a link between celltypes and induce the activation of a range of behaviors, i.e. proliferation...clonal expansion of T-cells, and also the production of other cytokines and growth factors. 

We have information about 3 to 4 different compartment of metastatic lesions in the liver from which absolut concentrations of around 50 different cytokines were measured by luminex essay. As each compartment is a mixed population of celltypes we will approach our model treating each compartment as the combined effect of different celltypes (a metapopulation) from which interaction within the same compartment are obviated to one metapopulation. 

Interactions within the immune system (IS) not only work against phatogens but also have a competitive interaction against cancer. Cancer vary among individuals to a high degree, hoever the all share commonalities as a disease. A considerable number of (de)activation events and signaling moleculas are involved in the anti-tumoral  immune response leading to a very complex system. A dynamic equilibrium is reached for which in this case the tumor progressed althpugh differently among patients. Some patients have better prognosis than other, or they show a better response to treatment. Underneath this variability, the factors enhancing one patiens prognosis are encrypted.

* Cytokines are a set of signaling polypeptides similar to hormones but opossingly: 
* act locally instead of at a distance. 
* They are carefully regulated.

Examples:

* Interleukins (1 - 18)
* Interferons (alpha, beta, gamma)
* Chemokines (CCL,CXCL, etc.)

Effects:

* cell growth
* cell differentiation
* cell death
* induce non-responsivens to other cytokines
* induce secretion of other cytokines

In order to model a cytokine network we must consider different factors:

* cell density
* activation/deactivation threshold
* secretion rate
*
