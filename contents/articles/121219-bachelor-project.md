Abstract: Brief description of my bachelor project

This project was aimed at looking at the interactions between a loss-of-function mutation and an environmental perturbation. I fluorescently labeled a collection of ~400 yeast mutant-strains which were assayed for growth in a set of different predefined laboratory conditions. The measurements were performed in an automated manner, monitoring at a pace of one hour for multiple growth cycles throughout one week. This project involved the development of a user interface for controlling the automated platform (written in python). It also required the genetic manipulation of different strains of yeast for introducing the fluorescently tagged gene, as well, after performing the corresponding experiments, the data was analysed using MATLAB.
