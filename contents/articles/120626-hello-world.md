Abstract: The birth of a new bunch of bits in the cloud. My own personal dominion on the pandorian cybernetic landscape. The millionth sand grain on the desertic storm, and bla bla bla.

Just for fun, this is a dummy post, just to provide some company to the first post, the "Hello World!" one. The main propose of it is exactly that. That just even with a lot of typos it gives a little bit more of content that just the first entry.

## This is an H2

*Consectetur adipiscing elit* a **phrase** with a bit of emphasis. Aenean porta ligula eget felis fringilla scelerisque. Aenean rhoncus dictum lectus ac vulputate. Ut ultrices dolor in diam elementum eget rutrum enim adipiscing. Etiam pulvinar augue nec dolor imperdiet condimentum. Class aptent taciti sociosqu ad litora torquent per conubia nostra, per inceptos himenaeos. Nunc vitae consectetur tortor. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque et augue tellus, condimentum porta lorem. Suspendisse ut est sem, at ornare nulla. Donec faucibus lacinia lorem, nec feugiat diam feugiat at. Quisque eu tellus ligula.

The previous text was generated by [lorem impsum](http://lipsum.org).

### We can also check the H3 heading

Or a simple unordered list:

* starting 

* with the first one or even a ad litora torquent per conubia nostra, per inceptos himenaeos. Nunc vitae consectetur tortor. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque et augue tellus, condimentum porta lorem. Suspendisse ut est sem, at ornare nulla. Donec faucibus lacinia lorem, nec feugiat diam feugiat at. Quisque eu tellus ligula.

* then the second item

* and finishing with

* the forth one

### we can also try an ordered list

Like thw following:

1. once or twice
1. even a third
1. time

Least but not last we can also try a block of code like the following, using a tab before, and the `:::python` identifyier for the markdown extension codehilite which uses pygments:

	:::python
	import this
	import sys

	for i in range(10):
		print i
	print 'Hello World!'
	#comment here

## We can also try some MathJax syntax

There was once this guy

end.

__An array like this:__

\\begin{array}{cc}
  a & b \\\\
  c & c
\\end{array}



##[Trying the MathJax thing](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/tex.html)

__Or Like This__

In inline style

	::latex::
	
	\e^{\pi i}+1 = 0 \frac{x}{y}
	
in html	

	::html::
	
	\\\\(e^{\pi i}+1 = 0 \frac{x}{y}\\\\)
	
and the rendered result:


\\\\(e^{\pi i}+1 = 0 \frac{x}{y}\\\\)


\\begin{equation}
   E = mc^2 \\\\
   e^{\pi i}+1 = 0 \frac{x}{y}
\\end{equation}

\\begin{equation\*}
   E = mc^2
\\end{equation\*}

The 2D normal function, the html:

	::html::
	
	f(x,y) = A \exp\left(- \left(\frac{(x-x_o)^2}{2\sigma_x^2} + \frac{(y-y_o)^2}...
	{2\sigma_y^2} \right)\right)
	
The result:

\\begin{equation\*}
	f(x,y) = A \exp\left(- \left(\frac{(x-x_o)^2}{2\sigma_x^2} + \frac{(y-y_o)^2}{2\sigma_y^2} \right)\right)
\\end{equation\*}


or inline thing $\\alpha = 10^2$

###[The Mexican Hat wavelet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_hat_wavelet)

__or the Ricker wavelet__ is the negative normalized second derivative of a Gaussian function, i.e., up to scale and normalization, the second Hermite function. It is a special case of the family of continuous wavelets (wavelets used in a continuous wavelet transform) known as Hermitian wavelets. It is usually only referred to as the "Mexican hat" in the Americas. The multidimensional generalization of this wavelet is called the __[Laplacian of Gaussian function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_of_Gaussian#The_Laplacian_of_Gaussian)__. In practice, this wavelet is sometimes approximated by the difference of Gaussians function, because it is separable and can therefore save considerable computation time in two or more dimensions.


__[A sombrero function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sombrero_function)__ (sometimes called besinc function or jinc function) is the 2 dimensional polar coordinate analog of the sinc function, and is so-called because it is shaped like a sombrero hat. This function is much used in image processing. It can be defined through Bessel function of the first kind


Now that we tryied every important aspect of a post entry, we can continue now, planning the next post.
Thanks!
