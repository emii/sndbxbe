Summary: First attempts to model cytokine signaling in cancer

I used a very simple toy model to start having an idea of how to integrate different cell types adn differnt cytikines into a agent based model.

Different interactions are difined for each cell types while a cytokine is expressed by a unique celltype, thus, we build a model with three different cytikines as follows:
