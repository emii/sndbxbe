Abstract: <strong>Abstract:</strong> Chromosomes change their  topology throughout the cell cycle varing its position and degree of compaction. This features have been observed to influence gene expression, as mutations perturbing the overall topology of the nuclear envelope have deleterious effects (see progeria syndrome). Previous methodologies have addressed chomatin conformation in different ways (see Hi-C, Paint probes 3D DNA FISH). However either their resolution is limited or, frquent error rate.

# Introduction

<!First we try to emphasize the idea of chromosome organization by connecting it to gene expression, hence to funciton>

The control of gene expression in eukaryotes can be viewed as the integrated response of mechanisms working at different hierarchical levels. Gene transcription is regulated from the sequence level to chromatin level, to the nuclear level (van Driel et al. 2003) **(see figure 1a)**. At this top-most layer, the higher order topology of the genome has proven to play an important role, as meaningful patterns of organization have been identified; after mitosis, chromosomes decondense into fibers which remain confined into well defined and isolated compartments called _chromosome territories_ (Cremer et al. 2010), gene-poor chromosomes are generally more frequently positioned in the outer regions of the nucleus, whereas gene-rich chromosomes adopt a more internal localization (Croft et al. 1999, **see figure1b**). Moreover, motion of genes along the radial axis of the nucleus has been observed upon gene activation, either toward the nuclear interior or toward the nuclear periphery, being the former not exclusively a repressive location (Andrulis et al. 1998, Boyle et al. 2001, Casolari et al. 2005, Mesiter et al. 2010). Alongside, distributed throughout the nucleus, sets of activated genes are spatially arranged into discrete foci called transcription factories &mdash;dedicated to the expression of specific combinations of genes, even from distinct chromosomes&mdash; (Spilianakis et al. 2005, Osborne et al. 2007, Schoenfelder et al. 2009 and 2010). This indicates that the associations at the transcriptional hot spots does not happen at random, but genes have preferential partners, commonly in a tissue specific manner (Osborne et al. 2007, **see figure 1c**). In addition, significant changes in spatial organization of genomes are triggered during cellular differentiation reflecting a dramatic change in gene expression (Kim et al. 2004).

<!Once I make the point of the importance of chromatin organization, I start talking about how is it organized, from structure, topology to dynamics within the cell cycle and independently during interphase>

The higher order structure of chromatin, meaning the ensamble of nucleosomes assuming a non-random conformation on the three-dimensional space offers an extra level of epigenetic regulation. Many factors may be involved in the modulation of nuclear conformations. Both local and long-range biochemical interactions between specific genomic regions, aswell as the anchoring of chromatin domains to the nuclear lamina, shape and constrain the available topologies for the chromatin to fold into, suggesting a link between the linear structure and the spatial chromatin conformation (Bickmore & van Steensel 2013). 

Recently, the development and refinement of thechniques that allow the mapping of genomic regions onto the spatial context of the nucleus &mdash;both in bulk and up to the single cell level&mdash; has allowed to have quantitative measures to describe the principles of chromatin organization. Methods derivated from 3C (Chromatin Conformation Capture, Dekker et al. 2003) uses formaldehyde crosslinking snapshots to quantify the distance between two genomic loci interpreted from the contact probability as closer regions are more probable to interact. 

The overall nuclear structure can be characterized by a set of features that range from spatial compartimentalization, degree of compaction, radial positioning within the nucleus, extent of intermingling, and differential distribution of processing machinery, among others. This DNA characteristics make it suitable for be approached with polymer models, departing from the idea of a beads on a string  simplification.
Biophysical models like the fractal and equilibrion model, or the random loop and the recent string and binders switch models require precise measurements of the relationship between the genomic and the physical distance


apparently the current general view of the nuclear organization explained as the sum of all functional features dictating preferential associations then constraining the topologies of the chromatin fiber modeled as a polymer. 

 

integrates i) the explanation of the folding by polymer models then constrained by biochemical interactions.
 
Finally, as both model and experimental data are integrated, the gain of understandig the nature of the emerging link between structure, composition, and function

>As will become clear below, the nonrandom distributionof DNA-sequence features is closely linked to chromatin-domain organization, although it is unknown how the former helps to establish the latter... &mdash; **Bickmore & van Steensel**



The current view of the dynamics of chromatin organization holds that after mitosis, the chromosomes decondense into fibers which remain confined into well defined and isolated compartments called chromosome territories during G0 or G1 interphase (G1,S,G2) G1 is characterized by growth, increase in volume

. Chromatin organization is linked to function, gene expression, can be divided in euchromartin and heterochromatin , gene-rich (internally )and gene-poor (envelope associated) regions, actively transcribed and inactive regions respectively, chromosome territory which is not randomly positioned and might be cell-type specific

FINALLY...thus the organization of the nucleus is a determinant factor of genome funcion and regulation, hence it is important to gain further insight to understand the link between chromatin topology, genome organization, and gene expression.  

Examples of long range interactions: trans activation, enhancer elements

structure:The arrangement of and relations between the parts or elements of something complex.

topology: The study of geometric properties and spatial relations unaffected by the continuous change of shape or size of figures.

architecture: The conceptual structure and logical organization of something

geometric arrangement of chromatin

architecture, topological features, structure, arrangement, etc

Chomatin is arranged in chomosomal domains, gloular regions where a chomosome is positioned and isolated from other chromosomal domains, and are thought to limit the interaction between different chomosomes.

.
Although the relative positioning between chromosomes might be cell-type specific, the degree at which chromosomes interact with one another stills to be assessed. Models for the chromatin conformation during interphase predict a higher frequency of intermingling than it is observed with the current methodologies. 

<!After talking about the chromatin structure I would start talking about the current methods to study it, a brief intro to C3 and DNA FISH>

Two main approaches are used to stablish the relationship between the genomic distance with the physical distance, the firts is the 3C and its variants, and the second is DNA FISH. The first one tell us about the average configuration of molecules, the conformation that is more prevalent among others so to say the prevalence of one configuration indicates that this process is non-random

Chromatin is formed by interactions between dna and proteins, this might hold together specific regions ether for long time or just transiently which might be or not sequence specific.

<!then I will introduce a bit of the polymer models to approach and answer physical properties of chromatin structure>

chromatin can be described at diferent levels, starting from the beads on a string model of the dna helix rapped around the nucleosome; the arrangment of nucleosomes together in either a 10nm or a 30 nm fiber, into a chromosome territory or into a tightly packed mitotic chromosome. It is for the higher order structures for which we know the less.



The geometric arrangement of chromatin fibers is conceptualized as an arrangement of nucleosomes in different configuration of compaction, from the 10 nm fiber offering a 1000 fold compaction to the classical 30 nm fiber offering a 10000 fold compaction. This is highly dynamic and varies throughout the cell cycle. Having a relatively stable period during interphase?

>with the beads-on-a-string organization of nucleosomes and linker DNA constituting the primary structure, and arrangements resulting from interactions between nucleosomes giving rise to secondary structures

<!Then i will finish with a summary, sort of a motivation >

## Motivation

Currently, the chromosome is viewed as an organelle consisting of non-random, differentially and tissue specific positioned arrangement of chromosomes into functionally distinct sub-domains called chromosome territories (Cremer et al. 2006). The spatial context of a gene within the nucleus as well as within a chromosome appears to have an important role on transcriptional control.Various cell-types may possess different chromatin arrangements accounting for variability in multicellular organisms, The impact of higher order nuclear architecture on these patterns in yet unknown.()

###Nuclei segmentation

Using DAPI staining fluorecence signal, two criteria were used for segmentation. First the nuclei were segmented using a otsu´s method for tfinding the optimal hreshold which minimizes the intra-class variance for intensity pixel values (under the assumption of a bimodal distribution), resulting in a binnary image were most of the nuclei were correctly segmented. Following this step, a second  criteria was taken into account for regions with an area above the average nuclei area (close nuclei segmented as one) covering more than one nuclei,for these regions, a subsequent segmentation using the watershed method was applyied, thus recovering the nuclei close to each other. Furthermore, nuclei adjacent to the edges of the field-of-view were discarded. Each of the resulting regions was dilated, thus preventing segmentation beneath the nuclei edges. The resulting binnary mask served to extract the following nuclei features: area, mean intensity, perimeter. This binary mask provided the
