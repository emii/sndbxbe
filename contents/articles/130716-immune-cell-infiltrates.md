Abstract: <strong>Abstract:</strong> Virtual Microscopy offers new possibilities through high-throughput automated microscopy of complete tissue sections. This approach allows robust and reproducible quantitative evaluations in tissues. Previous work by our group and others has shown that immune cell infiltrates can be used as predictive markers in cancer patients. This project therefore aims to generate an automated histological platform to quantify immune cell infiltration in cancer samples based on virtual microscopy. Integration of standard immunohistological tissue preparation and staining, virtual microscopy and imaging analyses into an automated workflow leads then to an improved individualized prediction and subsequent therapy selection in cancer patients.

#About TIGA

The TIGA Center Heidelberg started in 2007 as a cooperative initiative at the University of Heidelberg with the goal of building a bioinformatics platform dedicated to the understanding and characterization of altered tissue function in human diseases. Technically supporting the quantitative analysis and modeling of tissues is critically important when it comes to translating biomedical research tasks into clinically relevant applications. A key role in this translational process plays the high-throughput imaging and computer assisted analysis of tissue structures. Evaluating such tissue imaging data with bioinformatics approaches generates a wealth of yet unexploited clinically highly relevant tissue data. Such data in turn is a prerequisite for using such data in systems biological tissue models or clinical research. From the beginning on, the works in the TIGA were centered around whole-slide scanning. From the pure bioinformatics approach it then became soon clear, that leveraging the potential of whole-slide imaging for systems biology or systems pathology requires a concerted technical pipeline ranging from in-vitro to in-silico tissues. Our technical pipeline now integrates: In vitro tissue modeling Tissue sample processing Automated whole slide imaging (virtual microscopy) Quantitative image processing In-silico Tissue Modeling. Currently, the TIGA Center runs as a cooperative project of the Institute of Pathology, the Institute for Medical Biometry and Informatics and the National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT). It performs solely basic research and is exclusively funded by grants (mostly from the German Ministry of Education and Research, BMBF) with multiple research partners from different institutions like the German Cancer Research Center. It serves its cooperation partners from science and industry in leveraging the potential of systems biology, systems toxicology and systems pathology in tissue related clinically relevant biomedical applications. The TIGA is located and embedded in the structures of the BIOQUANT center, a leading interdisciplinary research network for systems biology in Europe.

#Tissue imaging

For automated tissue slide scanning the Hamamatsu NanoZoomer Digital Pathology (NDP) system is used. It allows the automated scanning of up to 210 standard slides in one batch with a mean scanning time of approximately 1 minute per slide (scanning a 15 mm x 15 mm region in 20x magnification) with an additional slide setup time of approximately 1 minute. The specimen can be scanned with either 20x or 40x magnification yielding a high spatial resolution of 0.46 µm/pixel and 0.23 µm/pixel respectively. This high speed as well as sensitivity is achieved by using a Time Delay Integration (TDI) high-speed sensor and scanning the specimen line-by-line. The 3 CCD detector gives superior colour reproduction of tissue samples being able to discriminate even between slight colour changes. 
In addition to the NDP standard brightfield equipment this scanner also includes optional fluorescence illumination optics allowing also the digitisation of fluorescence labelled samples.
After scanning the high resolution-images with a total of approximately 2 GB are presented on a dedicated slide image webserver and can be viewed comfortably from any workstation using the viewer software from Hamamatsu. For further analysis e.g. image analysis the images can be compressed and converted to any desired image format.

#Tissue analysis

Currently, there's a great need for the quantitative characterization of protein expression in human tissues. These efforts, usually denoted antibody proteomics, allow the systematic application of protein-specific antibodies to functionally explore the proteome. Affinity reagents can be utilized in numerous forms, including in vitro and in vivo protein profiling. Affinity reagents can for example be spotted onto microarrays enabling protein arrays. Tissue microarrays allow the high-throughput profiling of specific antigen-antibody interactions. Especially, the computational analysis of large tissue sections allows obtaining comprehensive, statistically much safer statements, than can be obtained from the analysis of limited small microscopic images.
Generally, antibody proteomics is the key component for linking the molecular and the tissue abstraction level. Goal of the TIGA Center is to provide solutions for capturing and describing the spatial expression patterns of proteins in tissues. The coupling of functional systems biological models of protein expression with the computational image analysis of tissues offers new chances for the understanding of key processes of tissue differentiation and tissue homeostasis in general. This approach also offers the chance of practically improving diagnostics and therapeutics in daily routine. Last but not least, the analysis of tissues also is a fundamental prerequisite for a well-grounded computational modeling of tissues.

## Review of [Mocellin et al. 2001](#Mocellin2001)

The role of the immune syztem is important, or potential mechanism against cancer and tumor growth. Cytokines mediate the behavior of the immune system cells. Cytokines distribution in the microenvironment of the interface between the tumor malignant cells and the IS may reflect the state of the interaction between both types of cells.

Differences between infilttration of Is cells has been observed between primary tumor and metastasic tumors, also this differences and variability in IS infitration is highly correlated with pathologu severity, suggesting an active role of the IS controlling the growth of the malignant cells.

what are the elements of the immune system important for an effective immune response, what are these mechanisms?

cytokines are regulatory peptides produced by almost every nucleated cell. together with adhesion molecules they mediate the activiries and response of lymphoid cells. Thus, CK kinetics are important in determining the definig signals in tumor expansiona and should be addressed more in focus as modulators of the immune response in the tumor microenvironment.


more than 150 ck have been identified, those are then classified into two categories given the t helper cell producing the, either Th1 or Th2 (CD4<sup>+</sup>), _cell mediated immunity_, or _humoral immune responce_,
