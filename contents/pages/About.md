The name is Emiliano, 8 characters, too long. I am studying small living stuff (the one which is amazing, variable, beautiful, functionally superb). When I am not doing crazy experiments at the lab, I am moonlighting as a cheese burglar, and positioning my last loot on the Dutch-gouda black market. And when I am not saying nonsense, I am mostly playing the ukulele in an amateur  band of one-handed scarecrows in a bar for deaf chinese turtles.

Apart from coffee, my everyday recipe includes biology and scientific computing which I try to do passionately and fiercely.

Sometimes I find myself (...literally) handcrafting code in  in Python, other times doing image and data analysis in MATLAB; other times I simply do HTML/CSS. 

Occasionally I also do real experiments, now I am learning single-molecule RNA FISH on mouse embryonic stem cells.

I like simple things, like sandwiches and coffee (always nice opportunities to get to know people), I always squeeze up from the bottom on a tube of toothpaste, whatever that means, either trying to get the most of every day, or just as an obsessive-compulsive habit. I travel lite, toothbrush and towel. I am unlucky in cards

##sndbx.be is not science

I made sndbx.be just as an experiment, a sandbox to draft and release thoughts to the outside, to find a place for this voice in the densely populated cloud of ideas. A creative outlet and a personal dominion.
