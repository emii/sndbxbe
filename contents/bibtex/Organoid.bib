  abstract = {The intestinal epithelium is the most rapidly self-renewing tissue
	in adult mammals. It is currently believed that four to six crypt
	stem cells reside at the +4 position immediately above the Paneth
	cells in the small intestine; colon stem cells remain undefined.
	Lgr5 (leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5,
	also known as Gpr49) was selected from a panel of intestinal Wnt
	target genes for its restricted crypt expression. Here, using two
	knock-in alleles, we reveal exclusive expression of Lgr5 in cycling
	columnar cells at the crypt base. In addition, Lgr5 was expressed
	in rare cells in several other tissues. Using an inducible Cre knock-in
	allele and the Rosa26-lacZ reporter strain, lineage-tracing experiments
	were performed in adult mice. The Lgr5-positive crypt base columnar
	cell generated all epithelial lineages over a 60-day period, suggesting
	that it represents the stem cell of the small intestine and colon.
	The expression pattern of Lgr5 suggests that it marks stem cells
	in multiple adult tissues and cancers.},

  abstract = {Intestinal cancer is initiated by Wnt-pathway-activating mutations

	the cell of origin has remained elusive. In a previously established
	Lgr5 (leucine-rich-repeat containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5)
	knockin mouse model, a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase is expressed
	in long-lived intestinal stem cells. Here we show that deletion of
	Apc in these stem cells leads to their transformation within days.
	Transformed stem cells remain located at crypt bottoms, while fuelling
	a growing microadenoma. These microadenomas show unimpeded growth
	and develop into macroscopic adenomas within 3-5weeks. The distribution
	of Lgr5(+) cells within stem-cell-derived adenomas indicates that
	a stem cell/progenitor cell hierarchy is maintained in early neoplastic
	lesions. When Apc is deleted in short-lived transit-amplifying cells
	using a different cre mouse, the growth of the induced microadenomas
	rapidly stalls. Even after 30weeks, large adenomas are very rare
	in these mice. We conclude that stem-cell-specific loss of Apc results
	in progressively growing neoplasia.},

	These methods enable statistical quantification of abnormalities

	under which single crypts or stem cells derived from mouse small
	intestine expand over long periods. The expanding crypts undergo
	multiple crypt fission events, simultaneously generating villus-like
	epithelial domains that contain all differentiated types of cells.
	We have adapted the culture conditions to grow similar epithelial
	organoids from mouse colon and human small intestine and colon.
	
	METHODS: Based on the mouse small intestinal culture system, we optimized
	the mouse and human colon culture systems.
	
	RESULTS: Addition of Wnt3A to the combination of growth factors applied
	to mouse colon crypts allowed them to expand indefinitely. Addition
	of nicotinamide, along with a small molecule inhibitor of Alk and
	an inhibitor of p38, were required for long-term culture of human
	small intestine and colon tissues. The culture system also allowed
	growth of mouse Apc-deficient adenomas, human colorectal cancer cells,
	and human metaplastic epithelia from regions of Barrett's esophagus.
	
	CONCLUSIONS: We developed a technology that can be used to study infected,
	inflammatory, or neoplastic tissues from the human gastrointestinal
	tract. These tools might have applications in regenerative biology
	through ex vivo expansion of the intestinal epithelia. Studies of
	these cultures indicate that there is no inherent restriction in
	the replicative potential of adult stem cells (or a Hayflick limit)
