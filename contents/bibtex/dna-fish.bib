  abstract = {Over the past decade, tremendous progress has been made in understanding
	the spatial organization of genes and chromosomes. Nuclear organization
	can be thought of as information that is not encoded in DNA, but
	which nevertheless impacts gene expression. Nuclear organizational
	influences can be cell-specific and are potentially heritable. Thus,
	nuclear organization fulfills all the criteria necessary for it to
	be considered an authentic level of epigenetic information. Chromosomal
	nuclear organization is primarily dictated by the biophysical properties
	of chromatin. Diffusion models of polymers confined in the crowded
	nuclear space accurately recapitulate experimental observation. Diffusion
	is a Brownian process, which implies that the positions of chromosomes
	and genes are not defined deterministically but are likely to be
	dictated by the laws of probability. Despite the small size of their
	nuclei, budding yeast have been instrumental in discovering how epigenetic
	information is encoded in the spatial organization of the genome.
	The relatively simple organization of the yeast nucleus and the very
	high number of genetically identical cells that can be observed under
	fluorescent microscopy allow statistically robust definitions of
	the gene and chromosome positions in the nuclear space to be constructed.
	In this review, we will focus on how the spatial organization of
	the chromatin in the yeast nucleus might impact transcription. This
	article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Nuclear Transport and
	RNA Processing.},

  abstract = {Studies of higher-order chromatin arrangements are an essential part
	of ongoing attempts to explore changes in epigenome structure and
	their functional implications during development and cell differentiation.
	However, the extent and cell-type-specificity of three-dimensional
	(3D) chromosome arrangements has remained controversial. In order
	to overcome technical limitations of previous studies, we have developed
	tools that allow the quantitative 3D positional mapping of all chromosomes
	simultaneously. We present unequivocal evidence for a probabilistic
	3D order of prometaphase chromosomes, as well as of chromosome territories
	(CTs) in nuclei of quiescent (G0) and cycling (early S-phase) human
	diploid fibroblasts (46, XY). Radial distance measurements showed
	a probabilistic, highly nonrandom correlation with chromosome size:
	small chromosomes-independently of their gene density-were distributed
	significantly closer to the center of the nucleus or prometaphase
	rosette, while large chromosomes were located closer to the nuclear
	or rosette rim. This arrangement was independently confirmed in both
	human fibroblast and amniotic fluid cell nuclei. Notably, these cell
	types exhibit flat-ellipsoidal cell nuclei, in contrast to the spherical
	nuclei of lymphocytes and several other human cell types, for which
	we and others previously demonstrated gene-density-correlated radial
	3D CT arrangements. Modeling of 3D CT arrangements suggests that
	cell-type-specific differences in radial CT arrangements are not
	solely due to geometrical constraints that result from nuclear shape
	differences. We also found gene-density-correlated arrangements of
	higher-order chromatin shared by all human cell types studied so
	far. Chromatin domains, which are gene-poor, form a layer beneath
	the nuclear envelope, while gene-dense chromatin is enriched in the
	nuclear interior. We discuss the possible functional implications
	of this finding.},

	To understand the collective cell behaviours underlying tissue morphogenesis,
	we have continuously quantified cell intercalation and cell shape
	change during GBE. We show that the fast, early phase of GBE depends
	on cell shape change in addition to cell intercalation. In antero-posterior
	patterning mutants such as those for the gap gene Kr\"{u}ppel, defective
	polarized cell intercalation is compensated for by an increase in
	antero-posterior cell elongation, such that the initial rate of extension
	remains the same. Spatio-temporal patterns of cell behaviours indicate
	that an antero-posterior tensile force deforms the germ band, causing
	the cells to change shape passively. The rate of antero-posterior
	cell elongation is reduced in twist mutant embryos, which lack mesoderm.
	We propose that cell shape change contributing to germ-band extension
	is a passive response to mechanical forces caused by the invaginating
	mesoderm.},

	Switching between a state that suppresses transcription and one that
	is permissive for gene activity probably occurs at the level of the

	by the interplay between histone modification, DNA methylation, and
	a variety of repressive and activating mechanisms. This regulatory
	level is combined with control mechanisms that switch individual
	genes in the cluster on and off, depending on the properties of the
	promoter. The third level is the nuclear level, which includes the
	dynamic 3D spatial organization of the genome inside the cell nucleus.
	The nucleus is structurally and functionally compartmentalized and

	are higher order structures that encompass portions of chromosomes,
	entire chromosomes, and even whole genomes. Interphase chromosomes
	are not positioned randomly within the nucleus, but instead adopt
	preferred conformations. Disparate DNA elements co-localize into
	functionally defined aggregates or 'factories' for transcription
	and DNA replication. In budding yeast, Drosophila and many other
	eukaryotes, chromosomes adopt a Rabl configuration, with arms extending
	from centromeres adjacent to the spindle pole body to telomeres that
	abut the nuclear envelope. Nonetheless, the topologies and spatial
	relationships of chromosomes remain poorly understood. Here we developed
	a method to globally capture intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions,
	and applied it to generate a map at kilobase resolution of the haploid
	genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The map recapitulates known features
	of genome organization, thereby validating the method, and identifies
	new features. Extensive regional and higher order folding of individual
	chromosomes is observed. Chromosome XII exhibits a striking conformation
	that implicates the nucleolus as a formidable barrier to interaction
	between DNA sequences at either end. Inter-chromosomal contacts are
	anchored by centromeres and include interactions among transfer RNA
	genes, among origins of early DNA replication and among sites where
	chromosomal breakpoints occur. Finally, we constructed a three-dimensional
	model of the yeast genome. Our findings provide a glimpse of the
	interface between the form and function of a eukaryotic genome.},

	often mediated by the formation of DNA loops: Binding at two or more
	sites on the DNA results in the formation of a loop, which can bring
	the transcription factor into the immediate neighborhood of the relevant
	promoter. These processes are important in settings ranging from
	the historic bacterial examples (bacterial metabolism and the lytic-lysogeny
	decision in bacteriophage), to the modern concept of gene regulation
	to regulatory processes central to pattern formation during development
	of multicellular organisms. Though there have been a variety of insights
	into the combinatorial aspects of transcriptional control, the mechanism
	of DNA looping as an agent of combinatorial control in both prokaryotes
	and eukaryotes remains unclear. We use single-molecule techniques
	to dissect DNA looping in the lac operon. In particular, we measure
	the propensity for DNA looping by the Lac repressor as a function
	of the concentration of repressor protein and as a function of the
	distance between repressor binding sites. As with earlier single-molecule
	studies, we find (at least) two distinct looped states and demonstrate
	that the presence of these two states depends both upon the concentration
	of repressor protein and the distance between the two repressor binding
	sites. We find that loops form even at interoperator spacings considerably
	shorter than the DNA persistence length, without the intervention
	of any other proteins to prebend the DNA. The concentration measurements
	also permit us to use a simple statistical mechanical model of DNA
	loop formation to determine the free energy of DNA looping, or equivalently,

	spatial organization of the chromatin fiber. Nevertheless, our understanding
	of chromatin folding is remarkably limited. Polymer models have been
	used to describe chromatin folding. However, none of the proposed
	models gives a satisfactory explanation of experimental data. In
	particularly, they ignore that each chromosome occupies a confined
	space, i.e., the chromosome territory. Here, we present a polymer
	model that is able to describe key properties of chromatin over length
	scales ranging from 0.5 to 75 Mb. This random loop (RL) model assumes
	a self-avoiding random walk folding of the polymer backbone and defines
	a probability P for 2 monomers to interact, creating loops of a broad
	size range. Model predictions are compared with systematic measurements
	of chromatin folding of the q-arms of chromosomes 1 and 11. The RL
	model can explain our observed data and suggests that on the tens-of-megabases
	length scale P is small, i.e., 10-30 loops per 100 Mb. This is sufficient
	to enforce folding inside the confined space of a chromosome territory.
	On the 0.5- to 3-Mb length scale chromatin compaction differs in
	different subchromosomal domains. This aspect of chromatin structure
	is incorporated in the RL model by introducing heterogeneity along
	the fiber contour length due to different local looping probabilities.
	The RL model creates a quantitative and predictive framework for
	the identification of nuclear components that are responsible for
	chromatin-chromatin interactions and determine the 3-dimensional
	organization of the chromatin fiber.},

  abstract = {In eukaryotes transcriptional regulation often involves multiple long-range
	elements and is influenced by the genomic environment. A prime example
	of this concerns the mouse X-inactivation centre (Xic), which orchestrates
	the initiation of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) by controlling
	the expression of the non-protein-coding Xist transcript. The extent
	of Xic sequences required for the proper regulation of Xist remains
	unknown. Here we use chromosome conformation capture carbon-copy
	(5C) and super-resolution microscopy to analyse the spatial organization
	of a 4.5-megabases (Mb) region including Xist. We discover a series
	of discrete 200-kilobase to 1 Mb topologically associating domains
	(TADs), present both before and after cell differentiation and on
	the active and inactive X. TADs align with, but do not rely on, several
	domain-wide features of the epigenome, such as H3K27me3 or H3K9me2
	blocks and lamina-associated domains. TADs also align with coordinately
	regulated gene clusters. Disruption of a TAD boundary causes ectopic
	chromosomal contacts and long-range transcriptional misregulation.
	The Xist/Tsix sense/antisense unit illustrates how TADs enable the
	spatial segregation of oppositely regulated chromosomal neighbourhoods,
	with the respective promoters of Xist and Tsix lying in adjacent
	TADs, each containing their known positive regulators. We identify
	a novel distal regulatory region of Tsix within its TAD, which produces
	a long intervening RNA, Linx. In addition to uncovering a new principle
	of cis-regulatory architecture of mammalian chromosomes, our study
	sets the stage for the full genetic dissection of the X-inactivation

  abstract = {We present a region-based segmentation method in which seeds representing
	both object and background pixels are created by combining morphological
	filtering of both the original image and the gradient magnitude of
	the image. The seeds are then used as starting points for watershed
	segmentation of the gradient magnitude image. The fully automatic
	seeding is done in a generous fashion, so that at least one seed
	will be set in each foreground object. If more than one seed is placed
	in a single object, the watershed segmentation will lead to an initial
	over-segmentation, i.e. a boundary is created where there is no strong
	edge. Thus, the result of the initial segmentation is further refined
	by merging based on the gradient magnitude along the boundary separating
	neighbouring objects. This step also makes it easy to remove objects
	with poor contrast. As a final step, clusters of nuclei are separated,
	based on the shape of the cluster. The number of input parameters
	to the full segmentation procedure is only five. These parameters
	can be set manually using a test image and thereafter be used on
	a large number of images created under similar imaging conditions.
	This automated system was verified by comparison with manual counts
	from the same image fields. About 90\% correct segmentation was achieved
	for two- as well as three-dimensional images.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the absence of internal membranes, the nucleus
	of eukaryotic cells is spatially organized, with chromosomes and
	individual loci occupying dynamic, but nonrandom, spatial positions
	relative to nuclear landmarks and to each other. These positional
	preferences correlate with gene expression and DNA repair, recombination,
	and replication. Yet the principles that govern nuclear organization
	remain poorly understood and detailed predictive models are lacking.
	RESULTS: We present a computational model of dynamic chromosome configurations
	in the interphase yeast nucleus that is based on first principles
	and is able to statistically predict the positioning of any locus
	in nuclear space. Despite its simplicity, the model agrees with extensive
	previous and new measurements on locus positioning and with genome-wide
	DNA contact frequencies. Notably, our model recapitulates the position
	and morphology of the nucleolus, the observed variations in locus
	positions, and variations in contact frequencies within and across
	chromosomes, as well as subchromosomal contact features. The model
	is also able to correctly predict nuclear reorganization accompanying a
	reduction in ribosomal DNA transcription, and sites of chromosomal
	rearrangements tend to occur where the model predicted high contact
	frequencies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that large-scale yeast
	nuclear architecture can be largely understood as a consequence of
	generic properties of crowded polymers rather than of specific DNA-binding
	factors and that configurations of chromosomes and DNA contacts are
	dictated mainly by genomic location and chromosome lengths. Our model
	provides a quantitative framework to understand and predict large-scale
	spatial genome organization and its interplay with functional processes.},

  abstract = {The automation of single particle selection and tomographic segmentation
	of asymmetric particles and objects is facilitated by continuing
	improvement of methods based on the detection of pixel discontinuity.
	Here, we present the new arbitrary z-crossings approach which can
	be employed to enhance the accuracy of edge detection algorithms
	that are based on the second derivative. This is demonstrated using
	the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter. In its normal implementation
	the LoG filter uses a z value of zero to define edge contours. In
	contrast, the arbitrary z-crossings approach allows the user to adjust
	z, which causes the subsequently generated contours to tend towards
	lighter or darker image objects, depending on the sign of z. This
	functionality has been coupled with an additional feature: the ability
	to use the major and minor axes of bounding contours to hone automated
	object selection. In combination, these features significantly enhance
	the accuracy of particle selection and the speed of tomographic segmentation.
	Both features have been incorporated into the software package Swarm(PS)
	in which parameters are automatically adjusted based on user defined
	target selection.},
