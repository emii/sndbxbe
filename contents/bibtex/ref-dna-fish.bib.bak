  abstract = {Transcriptional silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae at the HM mating-type
	loci and telomeres occurs through the formation of a heterochromatin-like
	structure. HM silencing is regulated by cis-acting elements, termed
	silencers, and by trans-acting factors that bind to the silencers.
	These factors attract the four SIR (silent information regulator)
	proteins, three of which (SIR2-4) spread from the silencers to alter
	chromatin, hence silencing nearby genes. We show here that an HMR
	locus with a defective silencer can be silenced by anchoring the
	locus to the nuclear periphery. This was accomplished by fusing integral
	membrane proteins to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and overproducing
	the hybrid proteins, causing them to accumulate in the endoplasmic
	reticulum and the nuclear membrane. We expressed the hybrid proteins
	in a strain carrying an HMR silencer with GAL4-binding sites (UAS(G))
	replacing silencer elements, causing the silencer to become anchored
	to the nuclear periphery and leading to silencing of a nearby reporter
	gene. This silencing required the hybrids of the GAL4 DNA-binding
	domain with membrane proteins, the UAS(G) sites and the SIR proteins.
	Our results indicate that perinuclear localization helps to establish
	transcriptionally silent chromatin.},

	in which regulatory mechanisms are integrated at three hierarchical
	levels. The first is the sequence level, i.e. the linear organization
	of transcription units and regulatory sequences. Here, developmentally
	co-regulated genes seem to be organized in clusters in the genome,
	which constitute individual functional units. The second is the chromatin
	level, which allows switching between different functional states.
	Switching between a state that suppresses transcription and one that
	is permissive for gene activity probably occurs at the level of the
	gene cluster, involving changes in chromatin structure that are controlled
	by the interplay between histone modification, DNA methylation, and
	a variety of repressive and activating mechanisms. This regulatory
	level is combined with control mechanisms that switch individual
	genes in the cluster on and off, depending on the properties of the
	promoter. The third level is the nuclear level, which includes the
	dynamic 3D spatial organization of the genome inside the cell nucleus.
	The nucleus is structurally and functionally compartmentalized and
	epigenetic regulation of gene expression may involve repositioning
	of loci in the nucleus through changes in large-scale chromatin structure.},

  abstract = {Genome function in higher eukaryotes involves major changes in the
	spatial organization of the chromatin fiber. Nevertheless, our understanding
	of chromatin folding is remarkably limited. Polymer models have been
	used to describe chromatin folding. However, none of the proposed
	models gives a satisfactory explanation of experimental data. In
	particularly, they ignore that each chromosome occupies a confined
	space, i.e., the chromosome territory. Here, we present a polymer
	model that is able to describe key properties of chromatin over length
	scales ranging from 0.5 to 75 Mb. This random loop (RL) model assumes
	a self-avoiding random walk folding of the polymer backbone and defines
	a probability P for 2 monomers to interact, creating loops of a broad
	size range. Model predictions are compared with systematic measurements
	of chromatin folding of the q-arms of chromosomes 1 and 11. The RL
	model can explain our observed data and suggests that on the tens-of-megabases
	length scale P is small, i.e., 10-30 loops per 100 Mb. This is sufficient
	to enforce folding inside the confined space of a chromosome territory.
	On the 0.5- to 3-Mb length scale chromatin compaction differs in
	different subchromosomal domains. This aspect of chromatin structure
	is incorporated in the RL model by introducing heterogeneity along
	the fiber contour length due to different local looping probabilities.
	The RL model creates a quantitative and predictive framework for
	the identification of nuclear components that are responsible for
	chromatin-chromatin interactions and determine the 3-dimensional
	organization of the chromatin fiber.},

	in situ hybridization to investigate the dynamics of gene association

	reactions that involve small numbers of molecules are intrinsically
	noisy, being dominated by large concentration fluctuations. This
	intrinsic noise has been implicated in the random lysis/lysogeny
	decision of bacteriophage-lambda, in the loss of synchrony of circadian
	clocks and in the decrease of precision of cell signals. We sought
	to quantitatively investigate the extent to which the occurrence
	of molecular fluctuations within single cells (biochemical noise)
	could explain the variation of gene expression levels between cells
	in a genetically identical population (phenotypic noise). We have
	isolated the biochemical contribution to phenotypic noise from that
	of other noise sources by carrying out a series of differential measurements.
	We varied independently the rates of transcription and translation
	of a single fluorescent reporter gene in the chromosome of Bacillus
	subtilis, and we quantitatively measured the resulting changes in
	the phenotypic noise characteristics. We report that of these two
	parameters, increased translational efficiency is the predominant
	source of increased phenotypic noise. This effect is consistent with
	a stochastic model of gene expression in which proteins are produced
	in random and sharp bursts. Our results thus provide the first direct
	experimental evidence of the biochemical origin of phenotypic noise,
	demonstrating that the level of phenotypic variation in an isogenic
	population can be regulated by genetic parameters.},

	interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-4 (IL-4), respectively,
	comprise two alternative CD4+ T-cell fates, with functional consequences
	for the host immune system. These cytokine genes are encoded on different
	chromosomes. The recently described T(H)2 locus control region (LCR)
	coordinately regulates the T(H)2 cytokine genes by participating
	in a complex between the LCR and promoters of the cytokine genes
	Il4, Il5 and Il13. Although they are spread over 120 kilobases, these
	elements are closely juxtaposed in the nucleus in a poised chromatin
	conformation. In addition to these intrachromosomal interactions,
	we now describe interchromosomal interactions between the promoter
	region of the IFN-gamma gene on chromosome 10 and the regulatory
	regions of the T(H)2 cytokine locus on chromosome 11. DNase I hypersensitive
	sites that comprise the T(H)2 LCR developmentally regulate these
	interchromosomal interactions. Furthermore, there seems to be a cell-type-specific
	dynamic interaction between interacting chromatin partners whereby
	interchromosomal interactions are apparently lost in favour of intrachromosomal
	ones upon gene activation. Thus, we provide an example of eukaryotic
	genes located on separate chromosomes associating physically in the

	inside the interphase nucleus has an important role in the regulation
