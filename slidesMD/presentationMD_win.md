## Chromatin topology plays an important role in gene regulation

## Distance between chromatin regions are measured from 3D positions of fluorescent spots
![slide2](/images/slides/chromatin-organization/slide2.png)
## Spots are identified for singles cells
![spotterUI2](/images/slides/chromatin-organization/spotterUI.png)
## Precise localization of the spots is estimated and corrected for chromatic aberrations
![gaussfit](/images/slides/chromatin-organization/slide4.png)
## Distances within single chromosomes are measured
![distances](/images/slides/chromatin-organization/slide5.png)
## Our results are in agreement with previous observations

### Outlook
#### Combinatorial labeling provides identifiers for unique regions

## Concluding remarks

* A major question in understanding spatial genome organization is how patterns of chromosome or loci organization are established and maintained

* Better resolution and perhaps multiplexing for the precise estimation of the localization of chromosome regions can be acheived by using our methodology 

* These measurements will provide insight in understanding the formation of patterns in chromatin organization
