## Chromatin topology plays an important role in gene regulation

## Chromatin organization is approached theoretically by polymer models
One characteristic feature of a polymer model is the mean-squared spatial end-to-end distance $\\langle R^{2}\\rangle$ which as a function of its genomic distance $g$ scales $\\langle R^{2}\\rangle \\sim g^{2\\nu}$, the exponent $\\nu$ varies given the dynamics of each polymer representation, such as random walk, self-avoiding walk, or globular state ([Tark-Dame et al. 2012](#Tark-dame2012))

* _Fractal globule_ ([Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009](#Lieberman-Aiden2009a))
* _Random loop_ ([Mateos-Langerak et al. 2009](#Mateos-Langerak2009))
* _String and binders switch_ ([Barbieri et al. 2013](#Barbieri2012))

## Nuclear Topology is experimentally addressed by 3C and FISH

## Capturing the dynamics of immune response

### Episim allows for the modelling of tissue-level together with its microenvironment



### The model would require:

* Integrate information about the tissue context in which cancer develops
* Capturing the evolution of the various cell populations (**AL**, **IM**, **LM**)
* Action of cytokines signals as activators/inhibitors of the immune cells
* Focus on the immune cell density of the **IM**
* Allow the evaluation of input parameters controling immune cell density and their activation state
* Immuno-depressed/activated -> tumor-dormancy/escape/elimination
